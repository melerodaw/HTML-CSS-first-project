## HTML-CSS-first-project

This project was an assignment to build a simple website using HTML with multiple sections and CSS for styling.

I decided to create a Counter-Strike 2 fan page. The main page layout is based on the official CS2 website because I found it visually appealing, while the rest of the pages were designed and built by me. Most images and GIFs are taken from the official CS2 site.
